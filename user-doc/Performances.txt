\page Openmp OpenMP

PLUMED is partly parallelized using OpenMP.
This should be enabled by default if your compiler supports it,
and can be disabled with `--disable-openmp`..
At runtime, you should set the environment variable
PLUMED_NUM_THREADS to the number of threads you wish to use with PLUMED.
By default (if PLUMED_NUM_THREADS is unset) openmp will be disabled at
runtime. E.g., to run with gromacs you should do:
\verbatim
export PLUMED_NUM_THREADS=8
mdrun -plumed
\endverbatim

Notice that:
- This option is likely to improve the performance, but could also slow down
  the code in some case.
- Results could be slightly different because of numerical roundoff and
  different order in summations. This should be harmless.
- The optimum number of threads is not necessary "all of them", nor should be
  equal to the number of threads used to parallelize MD.
- Only a few CVs are parallelized with opemMP (currently, \ref COORDINATION and
  \ref DHENERGY).
- You might want to tune also the environmental variable PLUMED_CACHELINE_SIZE,
  by default 512, to set the size of cachelines on your machine. This is used
  by PLUMED to decrease the number of threads to be used in each loop so as to
  avoid clashes in memory access. This variable is expected to affect
  performance only, not results.

\page MTS Multiple time stepping

By setting a STRIDE different from 1, you change how frequently
an action is calculated. In the case of actions such as \ref PRINT, this just
means how frequently you dump some quantity on the disk.
Notice that variables are only computed when necessary. Thus,
if a variable is only appearing as the argument of a \ref PRINT statement with
STRIDE=10, it will be computed every 10 steps.

In a similar fashion, the STRIDE keyword can be used in a bias potential
so as to apply the bias potential every few steps.
In this case, forces from this bias potential are scaled up by
a factor equal to STRIDE.

This technique can allow your simulation to run faster if you need
the apply a bias potential on some very expensive collective variable.

The technique is discussed in details here \cite Ferrarotti2015
