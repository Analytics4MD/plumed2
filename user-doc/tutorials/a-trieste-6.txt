\page trieste-6 Trieste tutorial: Real-life applications with complex CVs 

\section trieste-6-aims Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to train users to 
learn the syntax of complex collective variables and use them to analyze 
MD trajectories of realistic biological systems and bias them with metadynamics. 

\section trieste-6-objectives Objectives

Once this tutorial is completed students will be able to:
- Write the PLUMED input file to use complex CVs for analysis 
- Analyze trajectories and calculate the free energy of complex biological systems  
- Perform error analysis and evaluate convergence in realistic situations
- Setup, run, and analyze metadynamics simulations of a complex system 

\section trieste-6-resources Resources

The reference trajectories and input files for the exercizes proposed in this tutorial 
can be downloaded from `github` using the following command:

\verbatim
wget
\endverbatim

This tutorial has been tested on a pre-release version of version 2.4. However, it should not take advantage
of 2.4-only features, thus should also work with version 2.3.
 
\section trieste-6-intro Introduction

In this tutorial we propose exercizes on the following biological systems:
- the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1 complex) 
- the cmyc peptide in presence of urea at low concentration (cmyc-UREA)
- xxxx

\section trieste-6-ex-1 Exercize 1: analyzing trajectory of the BARD1 complex 

The BARD1 complex is a heterodimer composed by two domains of 112 and 117 residues each. 
The sytem is represented at coarse-grained level using the MARTINI force field.

In the TARBALL of this exercize, we provide a long MD simulation of the BARD1 complex in which
the two domains explore multiple different conformations.

The users are expected to:
- calculate the values of different CVs on the trajectory
- estimate the free energies as a function of the CVs tested (mono- and multi-dimensional)
- extracting from the trajectories the configurations corresponding to relevant free-energy minima
- calculate the error in the associated free energy using the block analysis technique
- evaluate the convergence of the original trajectory

The user is free to choose his/her favorite CVs.
However, we encourage all the users to experiments at least with the following CVs. 

1) RMSD from the native state


2) Distance from the native contact map


3) A CV describing the relative orientation of the two chains.


\section trieste-6-conclusions Conclusions

In summary, in this tutorial you should have learned how to use PLUMED to:
- Setup and run a metadynamics calculation.
- Compute free energies from the metadynamics bias potential using the \ref sum_hills utility.
- Calculate the error in the reconstructed free energy using block analysis. 
- Discriminate between good and bad collective variables.
- Evaluate the convergence of a metadynamics simulation.
