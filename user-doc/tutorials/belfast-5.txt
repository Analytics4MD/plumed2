\page belfast-5 Belfast tutorial: Steered MD

Steered molecular dynamics can be performed in PLUMED on any
collective variable by means of the \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT directive.
This directive is very flexible and allows for a programmed series
of steerings and can be used also to sample multiple events
within a single simulation.

\section belfast-5-TMD Targeted MD

Steered MD is often  used to drag the system from an initial configuration
to a final one by pulling one or more CVs. Most of time the aim of such simulations
is to prepare the system in a particular state or produce nice snapshots for a cool movie.
All the PLUMED CVs can be used in steered MD.
Targeted MD can be seen as a special case of steered MD where the RMSD from
a reference structure is used as a collective variable.
It can be used for example
if one wants to prepare the system so that the coordinates of selected
atoms are as close as possible to a target pdb structure.

\verbatim
# set up two variables for Phi and Psi dihedral angles
# these variables will be just monitored to see what happens
phi: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
psi: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17

# creates a CV that measures the RMSD from a reference pdb structure
# the RMSD is measured after OPTIMAL alignment with the target structure
rmsd: RMSD REFERENCE=ref.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL

# Steer the CV to a value of 0.0
# For long expression, it is convenient to split the command
# on multiple lines
restraint: ...
  MOVINGRESTRAINT
  ARG=rmsd
  AT0=0.0 STEP0=0 KAPPA0=0
          STEP1=10000 KAPPA1=10000
...

# monitor the two variables and the rmsd
PRINT STRIDE=10 ARG=phi,psi,rmsd FILE=COLVAR

\endverbatim
(see \ref TORSION, \ref RMSD, \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT, and \ref PRINT).

Note that \ref RMSD should be provided a reference structure in pdb format.
The \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT bias potential here acts on the rmsd, and the other two
variables (phi and psi) are untouched. Notice that whereas the force from the restraint
should be applied at every step (thus rmsd is computed at every step) the two torsions
are computed only every 10 steps. PLUMED automatically detect which variables are used
at every step, leading to better performance when complicated and computationally
expensive variables are monitored - this is not the case here, since the two torsions
are very fast to compute.
The desired position of the restraint at the beginning of the simulation is specified with
the keyword AT0. S
, and the target one with the keyword AT1.
The keyword KAPPA0 specifies the initial spring stiffness (no spring in this example),
and KAPPA1 the final one. AT0 is the position of the restraint at the beginning of the simulation,
and is set so as to target the conformation at zero RMSD from the reference structure.
Since the keyword AT1 is not used, PLUMED implicitly sets it as equal to AT0. Thus,
the restraint is not moving here but just "growing". 
The keyword STEP0 specifies at which step the parameters AT0 and KAPPA0 should be used
(here at the beginning of the simulation)
and STEP1 specifies at which step the parameters AT1 (implicitly equal to AT0 here) and KAPPA1 should 
be used (here at the end of the simulation).
One can follow the evolution through gnuplot by visualizing the instantaneous value of the CV by the simple command
\verbatim
p "./COLVAR" u 1:2
\endverbatim
 and obtain a plot like the one reported in XXX.

\section belfast-5-FE Estimating the free energy - Jarzynski equality
The reason behind the limited usefulness of such simulations is that they are "out-of-equilibrium" simulations
and they are not representative of equilibrium ensemble that is generally of interest for simulations.
