\page trieste-4 Trieste tutorial: Metadynamics simulations with PLUMED

\section trieste-4-aims Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to train users to perform 
metadynamics simulations with PLUMED, analyze the results, calculating free-energies as a function 
of the collective variables used, and estimating the associated error.

\section trieste-4-objectives Objectives

Once this tutorial is completed students will be able to:

- Write the PLUMED input file to perform metadynamics simulations 
- Calculate free energies from a metadynamics run
- Assert the choice of the collective variable
- Evaluate the convergence of metadynamics simulations
- Compute the error associated to the reconstructed free energies 

\section trieste-4-resources Resources

The \tarball{trieste-4} for this project contains the following files:
- diala.pdb: a PDB file for alanine dipeptide in vacuo
- topol.tpr: a GROMACS run file to perform MD of alanine dipeptide
- XXXX.py: a python script to perform error analysis

This tutorial has been tested on a pre-release version of version 2.4. However, it should not take advantage
of 2.4-only features, thus should also work with version 2.3.

\note We suggest to run the three exercizes in three separate directories. For Exercize 3, you will need the output of the first two exercizes, so don't delete it!
 
\section trieste-4-intro Introduction

We have seen that PLUMED can be used to compute collective variables. However, PLUMED
is most often use to add forces on the collective variables. To this aim,
we have implemented a variety of possible biases acting on collective variables.
The complete documentation for
all the biasing methods available in PLUMED can be found at the \ref Bias page.
In the following we will see how to build an adaptive bias potential with metadynamics.
Here you can find a brief recap of the metadynamics theory.

\hidden{Summary of theory}

In metadynamics, an external history-dependent bias potential is constructed in the space of 
a few selected degrees of freedom \f$ \vec{s}({q}) \f$, generally called collective variables (CVs) \cite metad.
This potential is built as a sum of Gaussians deposited along the trajectory in the CVs space:

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \sum_{ k \tau < t} W(k \tau)
\exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i-s_i({q}(k \tau)))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right).
\f]

where \f$ \tau \f$ is the Gaussian deposition stride, 
\f$ \sigma_i \f$ the width of the Gaussian for the ith CV, and \f$ W(k \tau) \f$ the
height of the Gaussian. The effect of the metadynamics bias potential is to push the system away 
from local minima into visiting new regions of the phase space. Furthermore, in the long
time limit, the bias potential converges to minus the free energy as a function of the CVs:

\f[
V(\vec{s},t\rightarrow \infty) = -F(\vec{s}) + C.
\f]

In standard metadynamics, Gaussians of constant height are added for the entire course of a 
simulation. As a result, the system is eventually pushed to explore high free-energy regions
and the estimate of the free energy calculated from the bias potential oscillates around
the real value. 
In well-tempered metadynamics \cite Barducci:2008, the height of the Gaussian 
is decreased with simulation time according to:

\f[
 W (k \tau ) = W_0 \exp \left( -\frac{V(\vec{s}({q}(k \tau)),k \tau)}{k_B\Delta T} \right ),
\f]

where \f$ W_0 \f$ is an initial Gaussian height, \f$ \Delta T \f$ an input parameter 
with the dimension of a temperature, and \f$ k_B \f$ the Boltzmann constant. 
With this rescaling of the Gaussian height, the bias potential smoothly converges in the long time limit,
but it does not fully compensate the underlying free energy:

\f[
V(\vec{s},t\rightarrow \infty) = -\frac{\Delta T}{T+\Delta T}F(\vec{s}) + C.
\f]

where \f$ T \f$ is the temperature of the system.
In the long time limit, the CVs thus sample an ensemble
at a temperature \f$ T+\Delta T \f$ which is higher than the system temperature \f$ T \f$.
The parameter \f$ \Delta T \f$ can be chosen to regulate the extent of free-energy exploration:
 \f$ \Delta T = 0\f$ corresponds to standard MD, \f$ \Delta T \rightarrow \infty \f$ to standard
metadynamics. In well-tempered metadynamics literature and in PLUMED, you will often encounter
the term "biasfactor" which is the ratio between the temperature of the CVs (\f$ T+\Delta T \f$) 
and the system temperature (\f$ T \f$):

\f[
\gamma = \frac{T+\Delta T}{T}.
\f]

The biasfactor should thus be carefully chosen in order for the relevant free-energy barriers to be crossed
efficiently in the time scale of the simulation.
 
Additional information can be found in the several review papers on metadynamics 
\cite gerv-laio09review \cite WCMS:WCMS31 \cite WCMS:WCMS1103.

We will play with a toy system, alanine dipeptide simulated in vacuo using the AMBER99SB-ILDN 
force field (see Fig. \ref trieste-4-ala-fig).
This rather simple molecule is useful to benchmark data analysis and free-energy methods.
This system is a nice example because it presents two metastable states separated by a high free-energy barrier.
It is conventional use to characterize the two states in terms of Ramachandran dihedral angles, which are denoted with \f$ \Phi \f$ and \f$ \Psi \f$ in Fig. \ref trieste-4-transition-fig .

\section trieste-4-ex-1 Exercize 1: my first metadynamics calculation

\subsection trieste-4-ex-1a Exercize 1a: setup and run 

In this excercise we will setup and perform a well-tempered metadynamics run using the backbone dihedral \f$ \phi \f$
as collective variable. During the calculation, we will also monitor the behavior of the other backbone dihedral \f$ \psi \f$.

Here you can find a sample `plumed.dat` file that you can use as a template.
Whenever you see an highlighted \highlight{FILL} string, this is a string that you should replace.

\plumedfile
# Compute the backbone dihedral angle phi, defined by atoms C-N-CA-C
phi: TORSION ATOMS=__FILL__
# Compute the backbone dihedral angle psi, defined by atoms N-CA-C-N
psi: TORSION ATOMS=__FILL__

# Activate well-tempered metadynamics in phi
metad: __FILL__ ARG=__FILL__ ...
# Deposit a Gaussian every 500 time steps, with initial height equal
# to 1.2 kJoule/mol, biasfactor equal to 10.0
PACE=500 HEIGHT=1.2 BIASFACTOR=10.0
# Gaussian width (sigma) should be chosen based on CV fluctuation in unbiased run
SIGMA=__FILL__
# Gaussians will be written to file and also stored on grid
FILE=HILLS GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi
...

# Print the collective variables and the value of the bias potential on COLVAR file
PRINT ARG=__FILL__ FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

The syntax for the command \ref METAD is simple.
The directive is followed by a keyword ARG followed by the labels of the CVs
on which the metadynamics potential will act.
The keyword PACE determines the stride of Gaussian deposition in number of time steps,
while the keyword HEIGHT specifies the height of the Gaussian in kJoule/mol. For each CVs, one has
to specify the width of the Gaussian by using the keyword SIGMA. Gaussian will be written
to the file indicated by the keyword FILE.

In this example, the bias potential will be stored on a grid, whose boundaries are specified by the keywords GRID_MIN and GRID_MAX.
Notice that you can provide either the number of bins for every collective variable (GRID_BIN) or
the desired grid spacing (GRID_SPACING). In case you provide both PLUMED will use
the most conservative choice (highest number of bins) for each dimension.
In case you do not provide any information about bin size (neither GRID_BIN nor GRID_SPACING)
and if Gaussian width is fixed, PLUMED will use 1/5 of the Gaussian width as grid spacing.
This default choice should be reasonable for most applications.

Once your `plumed.dat` file is complete, you can run a 10-ns long metadynamics simulations with the following command
\verbatim
> gmx mdrun -s topol.tpr -nsteps 5000000 -plumed plumed.dat 
\endverbatim

During the metadynamics simulation, PLUMED will create two files, named COLVAR and HILLS.
The COLVAR file contains all the information specified by the PRINT command, in this case
the value of the CVs every 10 steps of simulation, along with the current value of the metadynamics bias potential. 
We can use `gnuplot` to visualize the behavior of the CV during the simulation, as reported in the COLVAR file:

\verbatim
gnuplot> p "COLVAR" u 1:2
\endverbatim

\anchor trieste-4-phi-fig
\image html munster-metad-phi.png "Time evolution of the metadynamics CV during the first 2 ns of a metadynamics simulation of alanine dipeptide in vacuum."

By inspecting Figure \ref trieste-4-phi-fig, we can see that the system is initialized in one of the two metastable
states of alanine dipeptide. After a while (t=0.1 ns), the system is pushed
by the metadynamics bias potential to visit the other local minimum. As the simulation continues,
the bias potential fills the underlying free-energy landscape, and the system is able to diffuse in the
entire phase space.

The HILLS file contains a list of the Gaussians deposited along the simulation.
If we give a look at the header of this file, we can find relevant information about its content:

\verbatim
#! FIELDS time phi sigma_phi height biasf
#! SET multivariate false
#! SET min_phi -pi
#! SET max_phi pi
\endverbatim 

The line starting with FIELDS tells us what is displayed in the various columns of the HILLS file:
the simulation time, the instantaneous value of \f$ \phi \f$, the Gaussian width and height, and the biasfactor. 
We can use the HILLS file to visualize the decrease of the Gaussian height during the simulation,
according to the well-tempered recipe:

\anchor trieste-4-phihills-fig
\image html munster-metad-phihills.png "Time evolution of the Gaussian height."

If we look carefully at the scale of the y-axis, we will notice that in the beginning the value
of the Gaussian height is higher than the initial height specified in the input file, which should be 1.2 kJoule/mol.
In fact, this column reports the height of the Gaussian rescaled by the pre-factor that
in well-tempered metadynamics relates the bias potential to the free energy.

\subsection trieste-4-ex-1b Exercize 1b: estimating the free energy 

One can estimate the free energy as a function of the metadynamics CVs directly from the metadynamics
bias potential. In order to do so, the utility \ref sum_hills should be used to sum the Gaussians
deposited during the simulation and stored in the HILLS file.  
To calculate the free energy as a function of \f$ \phi \f$, it is sufficient to use the following command line:

\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS
\endverbatim

The command above generates a file called `fes.dat` in which the free-energy surface as function
of \f$ \phi \f$ is calculated on a regular grid. One can modify the default name for the free energy file,
as well as the boundaries and bin size of the grid, by using the following options of \ref sum_hills :

\verbatim
--outfile - specify the outputfile for sumhills
--min - the lower bounds for the grid
--max - the upper bounds for the grid
--bin - the number of bins for the grid
--spacing - grid spacing, alternative to the number of bins
\endverbatim 

The result should look like this:

\anchor trieste-4-metad-phifes-fig
\image html munster-metad-phifes.png "Estimate of the free energy as a function of the dihedral phi from a 10ns-long well-tempered metadynamics simulation."

To assess the convergence of a metadynamics simulation, one can calculate the estimate of the free energy as a function
of simulation time. At convergence, the reconstructed profiles should be similar.
The option \-\-stride should be used to give an estimate of the free energy every N Gaussians deposited, and
the option \-\-mintozero can be used to align the profiles by setting the global minimum to zero.
If we use the following command line:

\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS --stride 100 --mintozero
\endverbatim

one free energy is calculated every 100 Gaussians deposited, and the global minimum is set to zero in all profiles.
The resulting plot should look like the following:

\anchor trieste-4-metad-phifest-fig
\image html munster-metad-phifest.png "Estimates of the free energy as a function of the dihedral phi calculated every 100 Gaussians deposited."

These two qualitative observations:
- the system is diffusing efficiently in the collective variable space (Figure \ref trieste-4-phi-fig) 
- the estimated free energy does not change significantly as a function of time (Figure \ref trieste-4-metad-phifest-fig) 

suggest that the simulation most likely converged. 

\warning The fact that the Gaussian height is decreasing to zero should not be used as a measure of convergence
of your metadynamics simulation!

\note The two observations above are necessary, but qualitative conditions for convergence.
A quantitative assessment of convergence can be obtained by performing an error analysis of the
reconstructed free-energy profile, as explained in the last exercize

\section trieste-4-ex-2 Exercize 2: playing with collective variables

In this exercize, we will run a well-tempered metadynamics simulation on alanine dipeptide in vacuum, this time
using as CV the backbone dihedral \f$ \psi \f$. 
Please complete the template `plumed.dat` file used in the previous exercize to run this calculation.

Once your `plumed.dat` file is complete, you can run a 10-ns long metadynamics simulations with the following command
\verbatim
> gmx mdrun -s topol.tpr -nsteps 5000000 -plumed plumed.dat
\endverbatim

As we did in the previous exercize, we can use COLVAR to visualize the behavior of the CV during the simulation.
Here we will plot at the same time the evolution of the metadynamics CV \f$ \psi \f$ and of the other dihedral \f$ \phi \f$.

\verbatim
gnuplot> p "COLVAR" u 1:2, "" u 1:3
\endverbatim

\anchor trieste-4-metad-psi-phi-fig
\image html munster-metad-psi-phi.png "Time evolution of the dihedrals phi and psi during a 10-ns long metadynamics simulation using psi as CV."

By inspecting Figure \ref trieste-4-metad-psi-phi-fig, we notice that something different happened compared to the previous exercize.
At first the behavior of \f$ \psi \f$ looks diffusive in the entire CV space. However, around t=1 ns, \f$ \psi \f$ 
seems trapped in a region of the CV space in which it was previously diffusing without problems. 
The reason is that the non-biased CV \f$ \phi \f$ after a while has jumped into a different local minima.
Since \f$ \phi \f$ is not directly biased, one has to wait for this (slow) degree of freedom to 
equilibrate before the free energy along \f$ \psi \f$ can converge.

Try to repeat the analysis done in the previous exercize, i.e.  calculate the estimate of the free energy as a function of time,
first step to assess the convergence of this metadynamics simulation.
