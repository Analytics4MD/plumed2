\page belfast-7 Belfast tutorial: Replica exchange I

\section Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the users to running a parallel tempering (PT) calculation using plumed. 
We will set up a simple calculation on alanine dipeptide in vacuum, analyze the output, calculate free energies
from the simulation, and detect problems. We will also learn how to run a combined Parallel Tempering metadynamics simulation (PTMetaD) and 
introduce the users to the well-tempered ensemble (WTE).

\section belfast-7-lo Learning Outcomes

Once this tutorial is completed students will:

- Know how to run a PT simulation 
- Know how to analyse the output of the PT simulation and detect problems
- Know how to run a PTMetaD simulation 
- Know how to run a PT and PTMetaD in WTE 

\section Resources

The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23916760/belfast-7.tar.gz" download="belfast-7.tar.gz"> tarball </a> for this project contains the following directories:

- Exercise_1_2: run a PT simulation using 2 replicas and analyze the output  
- Exercise_3: run a PT simulation using 4 replicas and analyze the output
- Exercise_4: run a PTMetaD simulation
- Exercise_5: run a PT-WTE and PTMetaD-WTE simulations

Every directories contain the following subdirectories:
