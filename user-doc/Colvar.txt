\page Colvar Collective Variables

Chemical systems contain an enormous number atoms, which, in most cases makes it simply impossible for
us to understand anything by monitoring the atom postions directly.  Consquentially,
we introduce Collective variables (CVs) that describe the chemical processes we are 
interested in and monitor these simpler quantities instead.  These CVs are used in many of the methods 
implemented in PLUMED - there values can be monitored using \ref PRINT, \ref Function of them can be calculated
or they can be analyzed or biased using the \ref Analysis and \ref Bias "Biasing" methods implemented in PLUMED.  
Before doing any of these things however we first have to tell PLUMED how to calculate them.

The following list contains descriptions of a number of the colvars that are currently implemented in PLUMED 2.

\section dists Distances from reference configurations

One colvar that has been shown to be very sucessful in studying protein folding is the distance between the instantaneous configuration
and a reference configuration - often the structure of the folded state.  When the free energy of a protein is shown as a function
of this collective variable there is a minima for low values of the CV, which is due to the folded state of the protein.  There is 
then a second minima at higher values of the CV, which is the minima corresponding to the unfolded state.

A slight problem with this sort of collective variable is that there are many different ways of calculating the distance from a 
particular reference structure.  The simplest - adding together the distances by which each of the atoms has been translated in
going from the reference configuration to the instantanous configuration - is not particularly sensible.  A distance calculated
in this way does not neglect translation of the center of mass of the molecule and rotation of the frame of reference.  A common practise
is thus to remove these components by calculating the \ref RMSD distance between the reference and instantaneous configurations.
This is not the only way to calculate the distance, however.  One could also calculate the total ammount by which a large number 
of collective variables change in moving from the reference to the instaneous configurations.  One could even combine RMSD distances
with the ammount the collective variables change.  A full list of the ways distances can be measured in PLUMED is given below:

These options for calculating distances are re-used in a number of places in the code.  For instance they are used in some of the 
analysis algorithms that are implemented in PLUMED and in \ref PATH collective variables. 

\section mcolv MultiColvar Documentation

Often you do not need one of the collective variables described in the previous section.  What you want instead is a 
function of a distribution of collective variables of a particular type.  For instance you might need to calculate a 
minimum distance or the number of coordination numbers greater than a 3.0.  To avoid dupilcating the code to calculate
an angle or distance many times and to make it easier to implement very complex collective variables PLUMED provides
these sort of collective variables using so-called MultiColvars.  MultiColvars are named in this way because a single
PLUMED action can be used to calculate a number of different collective variables.  For instance the \ref DISTANCES
action can be used to calculate the minimum distance, the number of distances less than a certain value, the number of
distances within a certain range... A more detailed introduction to multicolvars is provided in this 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDvZmbWE5ps">10-minute video</a>. Descriptions of the various multicolvars
that are implemented in PLUMED 2 are given below: 

@MCOLVAR@   

To instruct PLUMED to calculate a multicolvar you give an instruction that looks something like this:

\verbatim
NAME <atoms involved> <parameters> <what am I calculating> TOL=0.001 LABEL=label
\endverbatim

Oftentimes the simplest way to specify the atoms involved is to use multiple instances of the ATOMS keyword 
i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3,...  Separate instances of the quantity specified by NAME are then calculated for 
each of the sets of atoms.  For example if the command issued contains the following:

\verbatim
DISTANCES ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6
\endverbatim

The distances between atoms 1 and 2, atoms 3 and 4, and atoms 5 and 6 are calculated. Obviously, generating 
this sort of input is rather tedious so short cuts are also available many of the collective variables. 
These are described on the manual pages for the actions.
 
After specifying the atoms involved you sometimes need to specify some parameters that required in the 
calculation.  For instance, for \ref COORDINATIONNUMBER - the number of atoms in the first coordination
sphere of each of the atoms in the system - you need to specify the parameters for a \ref switchingfunction
that will tell us whether or not an atom is in the first coordination sphere.  Details as to how to do this
are provided on the manual pages.  

One of the most important keywords for multicolvars is the TOL keyword.  This specifies that terms in sums 
that contribute less than a certain value can be ignored.  In addition, it is assumed that the derivative
with respect to these terms are essentially zero.  By increasing the TOL parameter you can increase the speed 
of the calculation.  Be aware, however, that this increase in speed is only possible because you are lowering the 
accuracy with which you are computing the quantity of interest.

Once you have specified the base quanties that are to be calculated from the atoms involved and any parameters
you need to specify what function of these base quanties is to be calculated.  For most multicolvars you can calculate 
the minimum, the number less than a target value, the number within a certain range, the number more than a target
value and the average value directly.  

\section multicolvarfunction MultiColvar functions

As well as the relatively simple quantities described above more complex functions of the distribution of values for the  
base colvars can be computed by employing multicolvars in conjuction with the following actions:
