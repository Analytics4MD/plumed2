\page ISDBintro PLUMED-ISDB

Here are listed the collective variables, functions and biases originally developed for the Integrative Structural and Dynamical Biology module of PLUMED. They are related but not limited to the interpretation and modelling of experimental data in molecular modelling.

\page ISDBColvar CVs Documentation

The following list contains descriptions of a number of the colvars that are currently implemented in the PLUMED-ISDB module.
These collective variables are related to the definitions of models to interpret experimental observables. They can be used in combination with any other collective variable, function or bias also outside the ISDB module.
