//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR DISTANCE
/*
Calculate the distance between a pair of atoms.
By default the distance is computed taking into account periodic
boundary conditions. This behavior can be changed with the NOPBC flag.
Moreover, single components (x,y, and z) can be also computed.

Notice that single components will not have the proper periodicity!
A possible hack is shown in one of the examples below.

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5,
the distance between atoms 2 and 4 and the x component of the distance between atoms 2 and 4.
\verbatim
d1:  DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5
d2:  DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4
d2c: DISTANCE ATOMS=2,4 COMPONENTS
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,d2c.x
\endverbatim
(See also \ref PRINT).

The following input computes the end-to-end distance for a polymer
of 100 atoms and keeps it at a value around 5.
\verbatim
WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=1-100
e2e: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,100 NOPBC
RESTRAINT ARG=e2e KAPPA=1 AT=5
\endverbatim
(See also \ref WHOLEMOLECULES and \ref RESTRAINT).

Notice that NOPBC is used
to be sure that if the end-to-end distance is larger than half the simulation
box the distance is compute properly. Also notice that, since many MD
codes break molecules across cell boundary, it might be necessary to
use the \ref WHOLEMOLECULES keyword (also notice that it should be
_before_ distance). The list of atoms provided to WHOLEMOLECULES
here contains all the atoms between 1 and 100. Strictly speaking, this
is not necessary. If you know for sure that atoms with difference in
the index say equal to 10 are _not_ going to be farther than half cell
you can e.g. use
\verbatim
WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100
e2e: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,100 NOPBC
RESTRAINT ARG=e2e KAPPA=1 AT=5
\endverbatim
Just be sure that the ordered list provide to WHOLEMOLECULES has the following
properties:
- Consecutive atoms should be closer than half-cell throughout the entire simulation.
- Atoms required later for the distance (e.g. 1 and 100) should be included in the list

The following example shows how to take into account periodicity e.g.
in z-component of a distance
\verbatim
# this is a center of mass of a large group
c: COM ATOMS=1-100
# this is the distance between atom 101 and the group
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=c,101 COMPONENTS
# this makes a new variable, dd, equal to d and periodic, with domain -10,10
# this is the right choise if e.g. the cell is orthorombic and its size in
# z direction is 20.
dz: COMBINE ARG=d.z PERIODIC=-10,10
# metadynamics on dd
METAD ARG=dz SIGMA=0.1 HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=200
\endverbatim
(see also \ref COM, \ref COMBINE, and \ref METAD)
