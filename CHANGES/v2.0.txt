Version 2.0.0 (Sep 27, 2013)
----------------------------

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite, so there is no way to write a complete set of difference
with respect to plumed 1.3. Here is a possibly incomplete summary of the difference:
- The input is simpler, more flexible, and more error proof. Many checks are now performed and in this way common errors are avoided. 
- The units are now the same for all MD codes.  If you want to use a different unit than the default you set it in the input file. 
- The analysis tools are now much more flexible.  As an example of this it is now possible to write different collective variables with different frequencies 
- Many complex collective variables are considerably faster than they were in plumed1.  In particular, all variables based on RMSD distances. 
- Centers of mass can be used as if they were atoms. Hence, unlike plumed 1.3, you can use center of mass positions in ALL collective variables.
- The virial contribution is now computed and passed to the MD code.  Plumed can thus now be used to perform biased NPT simulations 
- Variables can be dumped on different files and with different files, and are
  computed only when this is necessary.
- PLUMED is now compiled as a separate library. This simplifies the patching
  procedure, but might require some extra work to configure PLUMED properly.
  Since PLUMED can be loaded as a shared library, it is possible to setup
  everything such that PLUMED and MD codes can be updated independently from each
  other.

In addition, it is now much easier to contribute new functionality to the code because: 
- There is a much simpler interface between plumed and the base MD codes. This makes it much easier to add plumed to a new MD code. 
- There is C++ object oriented programming and full compatibility with the C++ standard library 
- A modular structure
- New collective variables and methods can be released independently
- There is an extensive developer documentation
- User documentation is provided together inside the implementation files
- Interfacing with MD codes is simpler. Hopefully, in the future, these
  interface will be maitained by the developers of the MD codes
  independently from PLUMED developers. This will allow more MD codes
  to be compatible with PLUMED.

Caveats:
- PLUMED 2 input file (plumed.dat) has a syntax which is not
  compatible with PLUMED 1.
  Transition should be easy, but cannot
  be done just using the new version with the old input file.
- PLUMED 2 is written in C++, thus requires a C++ compiler
- PLUMED 2 may not include all the features that were available
  in PLUMED 1.

A tutorial explaining how to move from PLUMED 1 to PLUMED 2 is available (see \ref moving).

Version 2.0.1 (Nov 14, 2013)
----------------------------

For users:
- Fixed a bug in \ref HISTOGRAM with REWEIGHT_BIAS. Reweighting was only done when also temperature-reweighting was enabled.
- Fixed a bug that was sometime crashing code with domain decomposition and
  non-dense simulation boxes (e.g. implicit solvent).
- Performance improvements for \ref GYRATION.
- Flush all files every 10000 steps by default, without need to use \ref FLUSH
- Errors when writing input for \ref switchingfunction are now properly
  recognized.
- Added message when \ref simplemd is used on a non-existing file.
- Fixed `plumed mklib` such that it deletes the target shared library in case
  of compilation error.
- Several small fixes in documentation and log file.

For developers:
- Added possibility to setup replica exchange from MD codes in fortran (commands "GREX setMPIFIntercomm" and "GREX setMPIFIntracomm").
- cmd("setStopFlag") should now be called after PLUMED initialization.
- Several small fixes in documentation.

Unreleased changes
-------------
See <a href="http://github.com/plumed/plumed2/tree/v2.0">branch v2.0 on git repository</a>.

For users:
- Fixed bug with \ref READ and periodic variables.
- Added full reference (page/number) to published paper in doc and log.
- Fixed a bug in file backups (only affecting Windows version - thanks to T. Giorgino).
- Added possibility to search in the documentation.
- Several small fixes in documentation and log file.

For developers:
- Fixed makefile dependencies in some auxiliary files in src/lib (src/lib/*cmake and src/lib/*inc).
- Changed way modules are linked in src/.
  E.g. src/colvar/tools/ is not anymore a symlink to src/colvar but a real directory.
- Removed include graphs in the documentation (too large).
- Several small fixes in documentation.
