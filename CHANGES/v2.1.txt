Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).

- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
