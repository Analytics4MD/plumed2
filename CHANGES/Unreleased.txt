@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

Include all fixes in branch 2.0 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-0 .

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for users:
- Added WALKERS_MPI to \ref METAD, allowing to run multiple walkers in a mpi-based multi-replica framework.
- Added ACCELERATION to \ref METAD, allowing to calculate on the fly the Metadynamics acceleration factor.
- Added option PRECISION to set number of digits in \ref DUMPATOMS.
- Added NDX_FILE and NDX_GROUP to action \ref GROUP, allowing to import atom lists from ndx files.
- Several optimizations in the following actions: \ref WHOLEMOLECULES, ...
- Faster atom scattering with domain decomposition.
- \ref SPRINT topological collective variables.
- \ref CH3SHIFTS collective variable.
- Improved multicolvar neighbor lists.
- Maximum colvar as well as minimum colvar is now possible.
- \ref COMMITTOR analysis.
- Added possibility to use negative strides in atom ranges (e.g. 10-1:-3).
- Added possibility to use \ref COORDINATION or \ref DHENERGY with NLIST in replica exchange simulations.
- Added STRETCH flag to \ref switchingfunction.

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).
- Improved class Communicator. Many operations can now be done directly on Vectors, Tensors, std::vector and PLMD::Matrix.
- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
- Fixed dependencies among actions such that it is now possible (and reliable)
  to use MPI calls inside Action::prepare()
