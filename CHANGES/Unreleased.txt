@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

Include all fixes in branch 2.0 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-0 .

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - \ref COORDINATION now skips pairs of one atom with itself.
- New configuration system based on autoconf (use ./configure from root directory).
  Optional packages are detected at compile time and correctly
  enabled or disabled. An internal version of lapack and blas will be used
  if these libraries are not installed.
- The command SPHERE has been replaced by \ref UWALLS
- New actions:
  - \ref SPRINT topological collective variables.
  - \ref CH3SHIFTS collective variable.
  - \ref COMMITTOR analysis.
  - \ref LOCAL_AVERAGE.
  - \ref NLINKS.
  - \ref DIHCOR.
  - \ref NOE.
  - \ref RDC.
  - \ref CLASSICAL_MDS
  - \ref XDISTANCES
  - \ref YDISTANCES 
  - \ref ZDISTANCES
  - \ref DUMPMULTICOLVAR
  - Crystallation module, including \ref Q4, \ref Q6, \ref LOCAL_Q4, \ref LOCAL_Q6, \ref MOLECULES, \ref SIMPLECUBIC, \ref TETRAHEDRAL and \ref FCCUBIC.
- New features for existing actions:
  - \ref METAD : WALKERS_MPI flag (multiple walkers in a mpi-based multi-replica framework),
    ACCELERATION flag (calculate on the fly the Metadynamics acceleration factor),
    TAU option (alternative way to set Gaussian height in well-tempered metadynamics),
    GRID_SPACING (alternative to GRID_BIN to set grid spacing).
    Notice that now one can also omit GRID_BIN and GRID_SPACING when using
    fixed size Gaussian, and the grid spacing will be automatically set.
  - \ref COORDINATION : if a single group is provided, it avoids permuted atom indexes and runs
    at twice the speed.
  - \ref DUMPATOMS : PRECISION option to set number of digits in output file.
  - \ref GROUP : NDX_FILE and NDX_GROUP options to import atom lists from ndx (gromacs) files.
  - In many multicolvars, MIN and MAX options can be used.
  - \ref HISTOGRAM: GRID_SPACING (alternative to GRID_BIN to set grid spacing),
    FREQUENCY and FREE-ENERGY flags in addition to standard probability density,
    additional option for KERNEL=NONE to accumulate standard histograms. 
- New features in MD patches (require repatch):
  - Gromacs 4.6.5 support \ref COMMITTOR analysis.
  - Gromacs 4.6.5 can be now be used to perform energy minimization.
- Other new features:
  - \ref driver can now read trajectories in many formats using VMD molfile plugin
    (requires VMD plugins to be compiled and installed). In case VMD plugins are not installed,
    the configuration system falls back to an internal version which implements a minimal list
    of plugins (gromacs and dcd) (kindly provided by T. Giorgino).
  - \ref switchingfunction : added STRETCH flag.
  - Negative strides in atom ranges (e.g. 10-1:-3).
  - \ref COORDINATION and \ref DHENERGY with NLIST now work correctly in replica exchange simulations.
  - Improved multicolvar neighbor lists.
- Optimizations:
  - Root-mean-square devations with align weights different from displace weights
    are now considerably faster. This will affect \ref RMSD calculations plus
    other variables based on RMSD.
  - \ref WHOLEMOLECULES is slighlty faster.
  - \ref COORDINATION is slighlty faster when NN and MM are even and D_0=0.
  - Atom scattering with domain decomposition is slightly faster
  - Link cells are now exploited in some multicolvars
  - Derivatves are not calculated unless they are specifically required, because for instance you are adding
    a bias.
-Documentation
  - All tutorial material from the recent plumed meeting in Belfast is now in the manual

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).
- Improved class Communicator. Many operations can now be done directly on Vectors, Tensors, std::vector and PLMD::Matrix.
- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
- Fixed dependencies among actions such that it is now possible (and reliable)
  to use MPI calls inside Action::prepare()
- colvar/CoordinationBase.cpp has been changed to make it faster. If you devised a class which inherits from here,
  consider that CoordinationBase::pairing now needs _squared_ distance instead of distance
- It is possible to run "make install" from subdirectories (e.g. from src/colvar)
- There is a small script which disables/enables all optional modules (make mod-light/mod-heavy/mod-reset)
- Added "-q" option to plumed patch
- You can now create new metrics to measure distances from a reference configurations. If you do so such
  metrics can then be used in paths straightforwardly
- You can now use multicolvars in tandem with manyrestraints in order to add a large numbers of restraints.
- Can now do multicolvar like things in which each colvar is a vector rather than a scalar.
