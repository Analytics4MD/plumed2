@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.3

Changes from version 2.2 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
 - \ref sum_hills expects the kernel type to be set in the input HILLS file
 - \ref METAD outputs the kernel type in the header of the output HILLS file
- New actions:
 - \ref PAMM probabilistic analysis of molecular motifs
 - \ref HBPAMM probabilistic analysis of hydrogen bonding
- New features for existing actions:
  - The SPECIES and SPECIESA keyword in MultiColvars can now take a multicolvar as input.  This allows one
    to calculate quantities such as the Q4 parameters for those atoms that have a coordination number greater
    than x.

Changes from version 2.2 which are relevant for developers:
- Many changes have been made to the KernelFunctions class. It is now possible
  to use multivariate Von-Misses ditributions within this class and the methods
  to read in kernels from input files and to normalise them have been changed.
