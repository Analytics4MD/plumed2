DO NOT EDIT configure FILE

One should edit configure.ac and the run autoconf in this
directory. Also the resulting "configure" is stored on the git,
so as to allow people not to install a recent autoconf on their
system.
If you modify configure.ac, remember to run
autoconf and then commit both files to the git repository.
